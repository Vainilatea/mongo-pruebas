Connect
You need to secure your MongoDB Atlas cluster before you can use it. Set which users and IP addresses can access your cluster now. Read more 

Add a connection IP address
Your current IP address (92.177.218.49) has been added to enable local connectivity. Only an IP address you add to your Access List will be able to connect to your project's clusters. Add more later in Network Access.
Create a database user
This first user will have atlasAdmin  permissions for this project.

We autogenerated a username and password. You can use this or create your own.

You'll need your database user's credentials in the next step. Copy the database user password.
